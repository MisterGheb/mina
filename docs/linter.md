# Linting
## Python

The Pylint is a static Python code analysis tool that finds programming and stylistic errors, bugs, invalid code constructs and inconsistencies with the coding standards. Moreover, Pylint can be customized to our needs by silencing some of the reported bugs, e.g. output messages can contain only information about errors for the most important programming issues.

Pylint message consists of five types of errors:

- R – means you have to refactor code following good programming practices.
- C – your code violates the coding standards convention.
- W – warnings for stylistic problems or some slight programming issues.
- E – means errors, there are important programming issues.
- F – fatal errors that stop code processing.

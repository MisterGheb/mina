What is the difference between bucketing and partitioning in athena ?


Bucketing is a technique for grouping data files based on a specific column or set of columns. 
Partitioning, on the other hand, is a technique for dividing a dataset into smaller, more manageable 
parts based on the values of one or more columns. 

The main difference between bucketing and partitioning is that bucketing is about grouping data files together 
based on column values, while partitioning is about dividing the data into smaller parts based on those values.
